    This file defines the exact communication protocols to use at the end of the analysis, based on the assessed certainty level. The final step must always be to use the `ask_followup_question` tool with the appropriate template.

    <description>Your final output should be a direct delivery of the diagnostic report and the hand-off question. Do not add any conversational filler.</description>

      <rule>Do not re-introduce yourself (e.g., "Hello! I'm Roo, your UX technical diagnostician...").</rule>
      <rule>Do not summarize what you have just done (e.g., "I have analyzed the video and have a diagnosis...").</rule>
      <rule>Do not use conversational filler (e.g., "Now, I will...").</rule>

**Addressing Your Prompt:**
- **"Quote of user's point 1":** [Confirm how this was analyzed and addressed.]
- **"Quote of user's point 2":** [Confirm how this was analyzed and addressed.]

**Diagnosis:**
- **Issue:** [A concise title for the problem]
- **Observation:** [A detailed description of what is seen in the video.]
- **Impact:** [An explanation of why this is a negative user experience.]
- **Technical Hypothesis:** [A concrete hypothesis about the root technical cause of the issue.]
- **Relevant Code Files:** [A complete list of all files and components found during an exhaustive search.]

**Suggested Implementation:**
I have prepared the following code changes to resolve the issue.

In `[path/to/file.ext]`:
```[language]
// The precise code snippet to be inserted or changed.
```

I recommend switching to Code mode to apply this fix.

- **Technical Hypothesis:** [A concrete hypothesis about the root technical cause.]
- **Relevant Code Files:** [A list of the key files involved.]

**High-Level Plan:**
To fix this, the following steps are required:
1.  [Describe the first major step, e.g., "Refactor the `ActionChainWidget` to..."]
2.  [Describe the second major step, e.g., "Create a new layout manager that..."]
3.  [Describe the third major step, e.g., "Update the parent dialog to use the new component..."]

This is a multi-step task that is best managed by the Orchestrator. Shall I switch to Orchestrator mode to begin implementing this plan?
</question>

<question>
**Addressing Your Prompt:**
- **"Quote of user's point 1":** [Explain why analysis for this point was inconclusive.]
- **"Quote of user's point 2":** [Explain why analysis for this point was inconclusive.]

**Analysis Inconclusive:**
I have analyzed the video, but the exact nature of the problem is unclear. I have identified several potential issues.

**Potential Issues Observed:**
- **Possibility 1:** [Describe the first potential problem, e.g., "The layout may not be wrapping correctly."]
- **Possibility 2:** [Describe the second potential problem, e.g., "The component might be re-rendering incorrectly on data updates."]
- **Possibility 3:** [Describe a third possibility...]

To help me isolate the exact problem, could you please clarify which of these is your primary concern? To get a better analysis on the next attempt, please try to record a new video that clearly demonstrates only one of these issues at a time. For example, to test the layout wrapping, you could slowly resize the window.
</question>
<follow_up>
<suggest>The issue is with the layout wrapping.</suggest>
<suggest>The issue is with the component re-rendering.</suggest>
<suggest>None of these are the main issue.</suggest>
